For clarity, such a CCS01 Command shall not affect any Link Key held by the CH and the register_device method shall return a result of 'success' in the corresponding action-result-action. Having authenticated the Command, the CHF shall add the Device to its CHF Device Log and so send a CS14 Alert containing the updated CHF Device Log. For clarity and in line with CS14 requirements, since the CHF has not established a TC Link Key to use with the Device at this point, the value of the hashed_TC_link_key field shall be a zero-length string in this Alert.\nThe CHF shall then check whether the value in the ieee_address parameter is for a Device Entity Identifier in its CHF Historic Device Log. \nIf it is not in its CHF Historic Device Log, the CHF shall allow SMHAN joining based on the Install Code specified in the key parameter, for the period specified in the join_timeout parameter.\nIf the value in the ieee_address parameter is for a Device Entity Identifier in its CHF Historic Device Log, the CHF shall, for the first half of the period specified in the join_timeout parameter, allow communications based on the associated TC Link Key in the CHF Historic Device Log.\nIf communications with the Device using that historic TC Link Key begin within the first half of the period specified in the join_timeout parameter, the CHF shall record that historic TC Link Key against the Device's Entity Identifier in its CHF Device Log. Since this changes the CHF Device Log, the CHF shall send a CS14 Alert containing the Device's Entity Identifier and the associated Hash of this re-used TC Link Key.\nIf communications with the Device using that historic TC Link Key do not begin within the first half of the period specified in the join_timeout parameter, the CHF shall then allow SMHAN joining using the Install Code specified in the key parameter for the second half of the period specified in the join_timeout parameter.",
